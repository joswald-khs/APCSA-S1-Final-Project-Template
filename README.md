###### _Processing Image Editor_

## Requirements

* Your program needs to display the working image  
* Your program needs to make changes to this image. These changes need to be done by applying an edit to each individual pixel. Your program should implement a minimum of three distinct changes. Example changes:   
  * black and white conversion  
  * saturate/desaturate  
  * blur/sharpen  
  * edge detection  
  * emboss  
* Your program needs to be able to revert to previous states of the image. The minimum here is reverting to the original image.   
* Your program should be interactive. This interactivity can be via keyboard shortcuts, mouse interaction, buttons, etc.   
* You must cite any resources used

## Ideas to Go Further

* Targeted adjustments  
* Multiple undo  
* Load/save images  
* Parametric adjustments (that is, not just applying a hard-coded adjustment, but allowing the user to dial up/down the effect).
